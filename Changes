    - Versions 0.15 - 0.17 still had $VERSION set to 0.14. Reported by Greg
      Oschwald.

0.17  Tue Feb  19 2013
    - Previous releases broke is_innet_ipv4 for many network formats. This
      support has been restored, but only the "a.b.c.d/nn" CIDR form will be
      documented going forward. All other forms are deprecated, and support
      for them will be removed in a future release.

0.16  Wed Feb  06 2013
    - Made the check for Socket.pm stricter. On some platforms it exports an
      inet_pton() that just dies when called. On other platforms it accepts
      invalid input like '016.17.184.1' or '2067::1:'.

0.15  Mon Feb  04 2013
    - If your installed version of Socket.pm provides an inet_pton subroutine
      we use that to do validation. This is about 5x faster for IPv4 addresses
      and 20 times faster for IPv6.
    - Various unroutable networks are now recognized as non-public
      addresses. Based on a patch by Greg Oschwald. (Bug#83081).
    - Added is_unroutable_ipv4 exported sub.
    - Added is_public_ipv6, is_private_ipv6, is_loopback_ipv6,
      is_multicast_ipv6, and is_special_ipv6 subroutines.
    - Fixed the is_linklocal_ipv6 method. It didn't recognize the full
      link-local range properly.
    - Fixed bug where '::' was not recognized as a valid IPv6 address. (Bug#81700)
    - Fixed bug where ipv6 related subroutines were not untainting their return value.

0.14  Thu Jan  06 2011
    - Cleaned up test suite (no code changes)

0.13  Thu Jan  06 2011
    - Fixed unshorted ipv6 check when ipv4 address is trailing. (Bug#64532)
        Thanks to Milan Matlak <milan.matlak@sde.cz> for patch

0.12  Wed Dec  29 2010
    - Fixed parsing of trailing :: (such as 2001::), as that is valid
        This address bug#58991 - Thanks to Alan.Chester@tekelec.com for identifying the problem
    - Also fixed incorrectly treating 2001::1: as a valid IPv6 address when it isn't
    
0.11  Mon Mar  01 2010
    - Added support for is_innet_ipv4 - simple check to see if IP is in network
        Thanks to "Bartłomiej Syryjczyk" <bartlomiej@syryjczyk.name> for suggesting the function
      

0.10  Thu Jun  04 2009
    - Added initial support for is_ipv6.  ipv6 is new territory for me, so please send in your 
      bug reports to me so that I can make sure I get it done correctly.

0.09  Fri Jan  30 2009
    - Removed AUTOLOAD
    
0.08  Wed Dec   6 2007
    - Fixed is_ipv4 to treat leading 0's in an ip as invalid, i.e.: 017.1.1.1 is invalid
        Thanks to Joshua D. Abraham <jabra@spl0it.org> for submitting the patch

0.07  Wed May  17 2007
    - Added POD testing, and minor cleanup related to that

0.06  Wed May  16 2007
    - Updated contact information to be neil@neely.cx, this is a purely cosmetic change

0.05  Tue Mar  6 12:42:11 2007
    - added is_multicast_ipv4 and is_linklocal_ipv4
        Thanks to Matt Dainty <matt@bodgit-n-scarper.com> for doing all the work
