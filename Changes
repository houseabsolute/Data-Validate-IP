Revision history for Perl extension Data::Validate::IP.

    - If your installed version of Socket.pm provides an inet_pton subroutine
      we use that to do validation. This is about 5x faster for IPv4 addresses
      and 20 times faster for IPv6.
    - Various unroutable networks are now recognized as non-public
      addresses. Based on a patch by Greg Oschwald. (Bug#83081).
    - Added is_unroutable_ipv4 exported sub.
    - Fixed bug where '::' was not recognized as a valid IPv6 address. (Bug#81700)
    - Fixed bug where ipv6 related subroutines were not untainting their return value.
